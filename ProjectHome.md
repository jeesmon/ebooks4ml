#### Using a different font in FBReader ####
Default font that comes with Android may not give good rendering for Malayalam. You can try a different font to see if rendering is better in FBReader. Steps are:
  * Download [Kaumudi.ttf](http://news.keralakaumudi.com/info/Kaumudi.ttf) to your Download folder
  * Change Settings -> Directories -> Fonts of FBReader to look for font in Download folder
  * In "Text" settings, choose Kaumudi font family

**Note**: Your device may not allow to download file with ttf extension. In that case download ttf to desktop, rename it to pdf, email to your mobile device, download pdf file and rename extension to ttf using [ES File Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop) app.
